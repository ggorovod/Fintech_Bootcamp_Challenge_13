A machine learning model that predicts whether VC applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

Provided with a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. 

With machine learning and neural networks, used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether a VC applicant will become a successful business.



   - Preprocessed data for a neural network model.

   - Used the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

   - Optimized the model
